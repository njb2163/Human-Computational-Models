My research focused on Microsoft’s Project Malmo and its Collaborative AI Challenge, a competition where participants developed AI capable of collaborating with humans to achieve a common goal. Specifically, I worked on designing cognitive agents that could simulate human cognition when interacting with AI agents from the competition.  

Project Malmo utilizes the Minecraft client to create environments for AI simulations. I programmed these environments in Python, which acted as an intermediary between the Minecraft client and the software used to develop our cognitive agents. My role centered on developing cognitive agents capable of interacting with AI.  

We based our cognitive models on the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) cognitive architecture, a psychological framework that breaks down human actions and behaviors into discrete operations, allowing us to effectively simulate human cognition. To implement our models, we used the ACT-R software, which is programmed in Common Lisp. My contributions included creating cognitive models within the ACT-R framework, ensuring proper communication between ACT-R and our Python environments, and managing data flow to facilitate interaction between the cognitive agents and AI solutions.
